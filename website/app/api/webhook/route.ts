/**
 * GitHub App webhook endpoint — dual-host ingress (Phase 1).
 *
 * GateTest is dual-host as of 2026-04-22: push / PR events can arrive
 * from Gluecron (via the Signal Bus at /api/events/push) OR from a
 * GitHub App webhook (this path). Both paths enqueue into the shared
 * `scan_queue` — downstream scan execution is host-agnostic because
 * `gluecron-client.ts` falls back to the GitHub REST API when a GitHub
 * PAT is configured.
 *
 * This replaces the 410 Gone placeholder that was in place during the
 * Gluecron-only migration (Known Issue #8, 2026-04-19 → 2026-04-22).
 * The Bible's strategic direction remains Gluecron-first long-term, but
 * GitHub is the distribution channel NOW — turning it off before
 * Gluecron has paying customers was a commercial misstep.
 *
 * TODO(phase-2): Post commit-status + PR comment back to GitHub after the
 * scan completes. The worker currently calls the Gluecron callback only;
 * a GitHub-host branch needs GitHubBridge in src/core/github-bridge.js.
 *
 * Wire contract: see website/app/lib/github-events.js for the full
 * contract, HMAC format, and event-handling rules. Unit tests live at
 * tests/github-events.test.js.
