/**
 * Self-scan history endpoint.
 *
 * GET — returns the last N (default 30) self-scan results, most-recent-
 * first. Used by a future trend chart on `/how-it-works`. Reads from
 * the same in-memory store as `/api/internal/self-scan-status`.
 *
 * No POST handler — history is appended as a side effect of POSTs to
 * the status endpoint. That keeps the wire surface area tight and
 * means there's only one place where signed publishes are accepted.
 *
 * See `website/app/lib/self-scan-status.js` for the storage strategy.
