### Stop duct-taping 10 tools together. One gate. 90 modules. Zero compromise.

Every engineering team eventually builds the same fragile patchwork: ESLint for style, SonarQube for code quality, Snyk for vulnerabilities, Lighthouse for performance, axe for accessibility, Percy for visual regressions, hadolint for Dockerfiles, tfsec for Terraform, actionlint for CI — each with its own config, its own dashboard, its own billing, and its own false-positive noise.

**GateTest replaces all of them with a single GitHub App.**

Install once. Every push and pull request is scanned by 90 AI-powered modules in under 60 seconds. A pass/fail commit status lands on your PR. If issues are found, GateTest opens an automatic fix PR — diff reviewed, fix explained, ready to merge. You only pay when the scan delivers value.

---

### How it works

1. **Install** — Click "Install" on this page. GateTest is added to your chosen repositories.
2. **Scan** — Every `push` and `pull_request` event triggers a full scan. No configuration required.
3. **Review** — GateTest posts a commit status (✅ pass / ❌ fail) and a detailed comment on your PR with every issue found, severity level, and the exact line.
4. **Fix** — On Scan + Fix and Nuclear tiers, GateTest opens a second PR with automatic fixes applied. Review the diff, merge, done.
5. **Pay on completion** — Your card is held but not charged until the scan finishes and delivers a result. If the scan fails for any reason, the hold is released automatically.

### What GateTest catches that your current stack misses

#### Security (12 modules)
- **SSRF** — Detects user-controlled URLs flowing into `fetch`/`axios`/`got` without validation. The bug behind thousands of cloud breaches.
- **ReDoS** — Catastrophic regex patterns: `(a+)+`, overlapping alternations, greedy unanchored `.*`. Finds them before a 10KB input locks your Node process for 30 seconds.
- **Hardcoded secrets** — API keys, JWTs, private keys, Stripe live keys, GitHub PATs — flagged before they reach `git log`.
- **TLS bypass** — `rejectUnauthorized: false`, `verify=False`, `ssl._create_unverified_context()` — the "just for staging" shortcuts that ship to prod.
- **Cookie security** — `httpOnly: false`, `secure: false`, weak session secrets (`changeme`, `keyboard cat`) across Express, Next.js, Django, FastAPI.
- **SQL migration safety** — `DROP COLUMN` without a rollback window, `ADD COLUMN NOT NULL` without a default, `CREATE INDEX` without `CONCURRENTLY`. The ops mistakes that cause 2 AM outages.

#### Code quality (10 modules)
- **N+1 queries** — Database calls inside loops across Prisma, Sequelize, TypeORM, Mongoose, Knex, Drizzle, node-pg, and MySQL2. Detects both block-form (`for`, `while`) and callback-form (`.map`, `.forEach`) loops. Recognises `Promise.all(arr.map(...))` as the correct fix.
- **Error swallowing** — Empty `catch {}` blocks, `.catch(() => {})` on promise chains, `process.on('uncaughtException')` handlers that don't exit, Node callbacks that ignore `err`.
- **Race conditions** — TOCTOU: `fs.exists` → `fs.unlink` on the same path (CVE-class CWE-367). ORM `findOne` → `create` without a transaction or `ON CONFLICT` handler (lost-update bug).
- **Resource leaks** — `fs.createReadStream` never piped to completion, `setInterval` with no `clearInterval`, `WebSocket` opened and abandoned.
- **Import cycles** — Circular dependencies in JS/TS detected via Tarjan's SCC algorithm. The bug that reproduces randomly based on module-cache warmth and test order.
- **Async iteration** — `.filter(async ...)` (Promise is truthy, predicate is meaningless), `.forEach(async ...)` (errors swallowed), `.map(async ...)` not wrapped in `Promise.all`.

#### Money and time safety (2 modules)
- **Float money** — `parseFloat(price)`, `Number(amount)`, `float(total)` on money-named variables — the bug that causes $0.01 drift over a million transactions. Safe-harbour for decimal.js, big.js, dinero.js, Python `decimal`.
- **Datetime timezone bugs** — Python `datetime.now()` without `tz=`, `datetime.utcnow()` (deprecated in 3.12+), JS 0-indexed month literals, `moment()` without `.tz()`.

#### AI and LLM safety (1 module)
- **Prompt injection surfaces** — User input interpolated into prompt templates without delimiters. `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` API keys bundled to the browser. `openai`/`anthropic` calls with no `max_tokens` (unbounded cost DoS). Deprecated model strings (`text-davinci-003`, `claude-v1`).

#### TypeScript safety (1 module)
- **Strictness regressions** — `strict: false`, `noImplicitAny: false`, `skipLibCheck: true` in `tsconfig.json`. `@ts-nocheck` file-wide suppression, unreasoned `@ts-ignore` comments, `as any` casts in exported signatures.

#### Infrastructure (5 modules)
- **Dockerfile** — Root user, `:latest` tags, `curl | sh` pipe installs, baked-in secrets, `chmod 777`, `ADD` with URLs.
- **Kubernetes** — Privileged containers, `hostNetwork: true`, missing resource limits, missing readiness probes, inline secrets in env vars, world-open `LoadBalancer` services.
- **Terraform / IaC** — Public S3 ACLs, `0.0.0.0/0` on SSH/RDP/database ports, unencrypted RDS/EBS/EFS volumes, `Principal: "*"` IAM wildcards.
- **CI workflow security** — Unpinned Actions (`uses: actions/checkout@main` instead of a SHA), `${{ github.event.pull_request.title }}` shell injection, missing `permissions:` blocks, soft-failing the quality gate with `continue-on-error: true`.
- **Shell scripts** — Missing `set -euo pipefail`, `eval` injection, `rm -rf $VAR` without quoting, hardcoded secrets, backtick command substitution.

#### Developer hygiene (5 modules)
- **Feature flags** — `if (true)` / `const FEATURE_X = true` — flags that graduated to "permanently on" and were never cleaned up.
- **PII in logs** — `console.log(password)`, `logger.info(req.body)`, `log.debug(JSON.stringify(user))`. The GDPR violation that ships in every codebase.
- **OpenAPI drift** — Routes in Express / Fastify / Next.js App Router that have no matching spec entry, and spec paths with no handler.
- **Cron expressions** — Invalid field counts, out-of-range values, impossible dates (Feb 30). Harvests from GitHub Actions schedules, Kubernetes CronJobs, Vercel crons, and source-code call sites.
- **Dead code** — Unused exports, orphaned files, 10+ line commented-out code blocks.
